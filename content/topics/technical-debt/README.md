## Technical debt fixing ideas and tackling

In his awesome blog post, Ahmed shares how we can approach solving technical debt as it should be taken seriously and
dealt with in a timely manner to avoid rooting the codebase and it is important to recognize when it is ok to leave some
technical debt and when it is necessary to take the time to address it.

A few tips are:

- Include the product owner early in the process and rally your team for support

- Have a meeting to discuss the pain points caused by technical debts and what are the logical approaches to solve them.

- Create sub-tasks to detail the technical debt so we have a tracked ticket to solve them. Don’t solve them on-spot to
  avoid consuming time.

- When the time for work planning arrives, vote to tackle them and hopefully you already have your team’s support

- Repeat the cycle as technical debt is a long-term commitment and won’t be solved in one day

In his article, he shares tips and ideas on how to practically tackle technical debt both from engineering and
management perspectives:

- Building trust among team members is crucial for tackling technical debt effectively. This involves being open and
  honest in communication, treating others with respect and kindness, and focusing on a shared vision.

- Making technical debt visible through tools like a tech debt radar can help prioritize the most pressing issues and
  drive progress.

- It's important to prove the need for technical debt management to stakeholders, highlighting the risks and financial
  impact of neglecting it.

- Breaking down technical debt into smaller, manageable phases and prioritizing using frameworks like the Cyfin
  framework can help make the job more manageable.

- Allocating dedicated time for technical improvements and making it a part of the development process can help drive
  progress.

- Engineers should take ownership of the code and lead by example in tackling technical debt, ultimately leading to
  improved results for the team and the company.
