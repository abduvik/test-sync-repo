## Product Development for Developers

During a recent Lunchclub meeting, I had the pleasure of speaking with
[Kamil Bukala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbukala/), the Co-Founder and CTO of TabsFolders.com. Our conversation
revolved around how developers can begin building their own products instead of solely working on projects for clients
or employers. Kamil shared some valuable insights that I would like to share with you.

- One idea that Kamil presented was to repurpose an existing product, changing how it's perceived, rather than starting
  from scratch. This approach can be beneficial for testing out ideas before moving on to actual implementation and
  saving time and money in the product development process.

- Another suggestion was to modify an existing source code to achieve our core concepts. This way, we can gain valuable
  insights and lessons early on in the product development process. This approach can also help save time and money, as
  we are building upon an already-existing foundation.

- Hiring remote teams for building a prototype at a relatively cheaper cost. Platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr are
  great resources for finding remote teams to create easy prototypes. These prototypes can be used to collect feedback
  from potential customers.

- Finally, Kamil mentioned that originality is not always necessary when attempting to solve a problem. One can find
  existing products and copy their ideas, targeting different markets with different demographics or geographics. This
  approach is similar to what Rocket Internet does, and it can be a successful strategy for building a product that
  meets the needs of a specific market.
