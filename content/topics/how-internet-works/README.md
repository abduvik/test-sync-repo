# How the Internet works

The internet consists of 7 network layers to communicate with each other which are:

1. Physical layer: Wires and transmission that handle physical aspects of networking.

2. Data link layer: Reliablity transmission of data over a physical link by implementing error detection and correction
   mechanisms.

3. Network layer: Handles the routing of data between different networks by using protocols such as IP (Internet
   Protocol).

4. Transport layer: Provides end-to-end data transfer between two devices by using protocols such as TCP and UDP.

5. Session layer: Establishes and manages communication sessions between devices, including authentication and
   encryption.

6. Presentation layer: Responsible for data formatting, encryption, and compression.

Application layer: Provides services to applications such as email, web browsing, and file transfer. (HTTP protocol is
here!)
