# ChatGPT

I think this has been the hype for the past few weeks and probably you have used it or knew someone used it. If not,
it’s basically a general-purpose chat AI developed by OpenAI. It can answer any question you ask it and it will reply
with a good answer.

I asked it to write a poem on Kubernetes, solve global warming, some political questions, translate text into German
with a Bavarian dialect, and even asked it questions in Arabic with an Egyptian Dialect.

Of course, I am aware it doesn’t understand what I mean and it lacks creativity as it’s eventually a model trained on a
massive amount of data. It’s similar to AI models used to predict the stock market, they are good for past predictions
but not for the unknown future which still requires the creativity of the human element.

It’s a great tool to try and learn as it can be integrated into your workflow and multiply your productivity similar to
what Github Co-pilot is doing now.
