# PoC vs Prototype vs MVP

We usually use these terms while working as they are the same but they are quite different.

**PoC (Proof of Concept):**

- Used to check if our idea is technically feasible and possible to implement
- Mainly for internal purposes and neglects UI, security, and development best practices
- Example: Simple Script without any clean code or infrastructure

**Prototype:**

- Early product sample to demonstrate a business concept before implementing it.
- Good for understanding the product and user journey to find any gaps that exist
- Examples: Miro Boards, Figma Designs

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**

- Itâ€™s a product with the minimum features that can be launched to market
- Used to validate the idea with real users and get feedback
- Examples: Using No-tools apps and WordPress SaaS
