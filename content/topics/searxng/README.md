# SearXNG

Did you know that each search entry you make on Google is stored and used to build a profile about you? and that Google
is using this to sell your data to advertisers or even to governments intelligence agencies?

That's why SearXNG is here to help you. SearXNG is a privacy-respecting search engine that doesn't track you. It is an
open source meta-search engine that aggregates results from more than 70 search services. It is a great alternative to
Google and other search engines. Also, it's much better to bypass results censorship and manipulation by these big tech
companies.

You can use one of the [public instances](https://searx.space/) or host your own instance.

Let's De-Googlify our lives!
