# Jest mocks

For unit tests instead of including a module that has long nested children that we donâ€™t care about, you can use the
`mock` function to mock these internal libraries

```js
jest.mock("../UserListContainer", () => () => "UserListContainer");
```

Just make sure that the path is relative to the testing file and not the component
