# Github X

I have been working on a huge consultation project for the past few months building a system similar to Monday.com or
Personio but for nursing facilities with the help of Github Copilot which has been an arsenal on its own helping me
programming in .NET which I never used before.

Now, GitHub has announced GitHub Copliot X which is the upcoming generation of Github Copilot and a few upcoming
features will be:

- Integrating the same model as ChatGPT-4
- Integrating Chat into VSCode which will help you understand pieces of code within the IDE
- Writing unit tests
- Writing Pull Requests descriptions
- Integration with Frameworks docs

Programming is never going to be the same and too much fun is coming up with this new toy :D
