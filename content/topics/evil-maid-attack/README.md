# Evil maid attack

The attack happens by gaining physical access to the device and trying to install firmware or software that can
intercept the data or the encryption keys (ex: key logger). This can happen especially in hotels or at airports or when
arrested by law enforcement personnel.

To protect against this attack, you will need to monitor the devices physically and there is also the use of TPM to
check the integrity of the device and the firmware.

Some ways to protect against this attack:

- Using glitter nail polish to seal the screws
- Using tamper-evident stickers on ports
- Using a secure boot process to check the integrity of the firmware
- Using [Haven app](https://github.com/guardianproject/haven) to monitor the device using the phone sensors
