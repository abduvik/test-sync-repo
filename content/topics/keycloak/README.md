# Keycloak

A complete solution to manage user authentication and authorization and it’s very easy to customize. This is really good
for apps that need quick prototyping and don’t have time to create such solutions and at the same time, they need their
data to be away from using cloud authentication services on AWS or GCP.

The only reason you might not use it is if you want to stay away from Java or you don’t have Java experience. Otherwise,
go for it!
