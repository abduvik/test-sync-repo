# Passkeys

Passkeys are a new way to authenticate users without the need for passwords. It's a more secure and user-friendly method
that uses public-key cryptography to verify the user's identity.

The passkey is generated by the user's device and it generates a public and private key pair. The public key is sent to
the server, while the private key remains on the user's device. When the user wants to authenticate, the server sends a
challenge to the user's device, which is signed with the private key. The server then verifies the signature using the
public key and authenticates the user.

This approach eliminates the need for passwords, which are often weak and easily compromised. It also provides a more
secure and user-friendly authentication method that is resistant to phishing attacks and other security threats.
