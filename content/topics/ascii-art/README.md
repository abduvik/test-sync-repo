# ASCII Art

Past weeks, we worked on a task to show the companyâ€™s logo in the Console and my colleague, Lisa, told me about ASCII
art which is a technique that uses the characters of the ASCII character set to create images.

To create ASCII art, we typically use the characters in the ASCII character set to represent different shades of gray or
colors. For example, the character "." might be used to represent the lightest shade of gray, while the character "8"
could be used to represent a darker shade. We can then combine these characters to create a picture or image.

ASCII art is often used in computer programs and online forums as a form of artistic expression. It is a popular way to
create and share art online, and many websites and forums have dedicated sections for ASCII art. Some people even use
ASCII art as a form of digital graffiti, posting it on websites and forums without the permission of the site's owner.
Despite its limitations, ASCII art continues to be a popular and creative way for people to express themselves online.
