# Issue #6: ASCII Art, Kubernetes, ChatGPT

Hey Friends,

The past two weeks were like two months of a lifetime :D

I did a lot of traveling, gave a talk on Developer Productivity at work, almost got fined 60 euros for an incorrect
ticket on the DB train, and spent too much time discovering ChatGPT which is part of this issue‚Äôs summary.

Upcoming weeks will be relaxed playing some Watch Dogs Legion on my PS4 and enjoying the holidays and Christmas üéÑ

Wish you all also Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas üéÅ

## Technical Summaries

### ASCII Art

Past weeks, we worked on a task to show the company‚Äôs logo in the Console and my colleague, Lisa, told me about ASCII
art which is a technique that uses the characters of the ASCII character set to create images.

To create ASCII art, we typically use the characters in the ASCII character set to represent different shades of gray or
colors. For example, the character "." might be used to represent the lightest shade of gray, while the character "8"
could be used to represent a darker shade. We can then combine these characters to create a picture or image.

ASCII art is often used in computer programs and online forums as a form of artistic expression. It is a popular way to
create and share art online, and many websites and forums have dedicated sections for ASCII art. Some people even use
ASCII art as a form of digital graffiti, posting it on websites and forums without the permission of the site's owner.
Despite its limitations, ASCII art continues to be a popular and creative way for people to express themselves online.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
applications. It consists of several components that work together to provide a complete solution for managing and
deploying applications. Some of the key components of Kubernetes include:

- The Kubernetes master: This is the main control plane for the Kubernetes cluster. It consists of several components,
  such as the API server, which is the main entry point for interacting with the cluster, and the etcd distributed
  key-value store, which stores the cluster's configuration data.

- The Kubernetes nodes: These are the worker machines that run the containerized applications. Each node runs a kubelet,
  which is the agent that communicates with the Kubernetes master and manages the containers on the node.

- The Kubernetes pod: This is the basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes. A pod is a logical host for one or more
  containers, which share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other easily.

- The Kubernetes deployment: This is a higher-level object that manages the deployment and scaling of one or more
  replicas of a pod. The deployment manages the rolling update process, which allows you to update the containers in a
  pod without downtime.

- The Kubernetes service: This is an abstract way to expose the pods to the outside world. A service defines a logical
  set of pods and a policy for accessing them, and it provides a stable IP address and DNS name for the pods.

### ChatGPT

I think this has been the hype for the past few weeks and probably you have used it or knew someone used it. If not,
it‚Äôs basically a general-purpose chat AI developed by OpenAI. It can answer any question you ask it and it will reply
with a good answer.

I asked it to write a poem on Kubernetes, solve global warming, some political questions, translate text into German
with a Bavarian dialect, and even asked it questions in Arabic with an Egyptian Dialect.

Of course, I am aware it doesn‚Äôt understand what I mean and it lacks creativity as it‚Äôs eventually a model trained on a
massive amount of data. It‚Äôs similar to AI models used to predict the stock market, they are good for past predictions
but not for the unknown future which still requires the creativity of the human element.

It‚Äôs a great tool to try and learn as it can be integrated into your workflow and multiply your productivity similar to
what Github Co-pilot is doing now.
