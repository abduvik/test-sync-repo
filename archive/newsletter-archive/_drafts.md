### Embedding Content

Most of us have idea about using iframes to embed external pages, img to embed images and video for eh video (dah :)

But you rarely hear about object and embed tags, including me too.

They are both are like “general purpose” tags to include external content and they support a wide variety of content
types (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

From what I found, embed is older than object and object doesn’t have full support of IE as it wasn’t correctly
implemented. Back in the days, they were mostly used to run Flash scripts in the browser. Nowadays, you might need them
to render a pdf into the browser.

Main difference is that object give more options and it offers to show a fallback content in case of failure. So, if you
would like to get all the extra features of object while still supporting IE (for some reason), then you can include
embed inside the object tag.

Example:

```
<object data="your-document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="600" height="400">

<!-- Fallback content for browsers that don't support inline PDF rendering -->

<embed src="your-document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="600" height="400">

It appears your browser does not support inline PDF rendering. You can <a href="your-document.pdf" download>download the PDF</a> instead.

</object>
```

### Jest vs Karma

Recently I have encountered the test-runner Karma. I have written a lot of tests using Jest and know how it works, so I
was curious about why Karma.

Karma is a test runner library that runs your tests using a testing library like Jasmine for example. It lunches your
tests either in a headless or a real browser.

Jest is a test runner and a testing library so you can think of it as Karma+Jasmine. It focuses only on running your
tests without browsers using jsdom. That’s why it’s multiple times faster than Karma when running unit tests as it uses
fewer resources and takes less time to execute.

The only downside is that Jest might miss some compatibility issues between browsers because you are using a certain
feature that exists in one and not the other.

My personal takeaway is to avoid Karma for unit tests and use Jest instead. Making unit tests run faster will encourage
developers to write more unit tests which will increase the application test coverage.

### How many Chromes Tabs do you have?

You can easily find how many Chrome Tabs are open by going to the following link in your browser

[chrome://inspect/#pages](chrome://inspect/#pages)

And search for the word “inspect”. You will get the number of entries which represents how many Chrome Tabs you have
open.

Maybe you can reply to this newsletter with how many Chrome Tabs you have :D

### How Hidden Services in the Tor network works

Hidden services have a reputation to be harmful and dangerous from all that we hear in the media and there is some truth
to it. But it can also be used as a strong force of freedom of speech and anonymity.

Here is a summary of it’s main actors and how it works:

Main Actors:

- Client: User/Browser that wants to connect to a hidden service

- Hidden Service: a Host that is hidden and no one can find its IP address

- Tor circuit: A collection of nodes that encrypt messages between two parties. Each node encrypts/decrypts the message
  of the other node on top of it (aka. Onion). Every party communicates with 3 relays and they are globally distributed.
  They are Guard-Middle-Exit relays.

- Introduction Points: Nodes that will be used to introduce the client to the hidden services

- Rendevouz Point: Node that will be used to connect the Client’s Tor Circuit to the Hidden Service’s Tor Circuit.

Steps of connections

1. Hidden Service generates a public key and a private key. The public key is used to generate the .onion address.

2. Hidden Service will contact a bunch of nodes (Tor relays) and ask them to act as Introduction Points. Communication
   between them is done through a Long-Term Tor circuit to hide the Hidden Service IP address. It tells them its Public
   key.

3. Hidden Service will generate an Onion Service Descriptor which includes the list of these Introduction Points and
   sign it with its private key.

4. Hidden Service will publish this Descriptor to a Distributed Hash Table. Communication is again done through the Tor
   Circuit.

5. The user gets the .onion address somehow and tries to use it.

6. The Client communicates with the Distributed Hash Table to get the descriptor and verify it using the public key

7. The Client communicates with a node and asks to be a Rendevouz Point and gives it a one-time secret. Tor Circuit is
   used between both of them.

8. The Client then communicates with one of the Introduction Points and gives them information about the Rendevouz Point
   and the one-time secret. Tor Circuit is used between both of them.

9. The Introduction Point passes this information to the Hidden Service through the Long-Term Tor Circuit.

10. The Hidden Service does multiple verifications and if it accepts it, it will connect to the Rendevouz Point and send
    it the one-time secret.

11. The Rendevouz Point compares the two one-time secrets and if they match, it will establish a connection between the
    Client’s Tor Circuit and the Hidden Service’s Tor Circuit making the Tor Circuit connection in general have 6
    relays.

### SystemJS

SystemJS is an alternative to `importmaps`, which are still not widely supported across different browsers. SystemJS
provides a way to manage and load JavaScript modules dynamically at runtime, enabling developers to use a variety of
module formats, including CommonJS, AMD, and ES6 modules. It is often used to manage dependencies and support
asynchronous module loading in web applications.

With SystemJS, we can import and use modules in a straightforward manner, without having to worry about cross-browser
compatibility issues with `importmaps` and ES Modules.

```html
<script src="node_modules/systemjs/dist/system.js"></script>
<script type="systemjs-module" src="module.js"></script>
<script>
  SystemJS.import("module.js").then(function (module) {
    console.log(module.default);
  });
</script>
```

It’s also possible to integrate it with Webpack using

```json
{
  "output": {
    "library": {
      "type": "system"
    }
  }
}
```

### Entity Resolution

Entity Resolution, also known as fuzzy matching or record matching, is a technique used to identify and link data
records that refer to the same real-world entity, even if they have variations in representation. It is crucial in
addressing data inconsistencies such as different spellings, abbreviations, and formatting across various data sources.

The technique is valuable for organizations dealing with imperfect data, as it helps connect disparate data sources,
clean data, and establish a unified view. This process is particularly beneficial in creating Master Data Management (
MDM) systems, where data from different sources is combined to develop a single source of truth.

Various industry use cases includes:

- Healthcare to combine information about patients
- Marketing and sales to create a unified and personalized customer experience
- Insurance to detect fraud and access risk
- Manufacturing to analyze expenditure over large geographies and optimize suppliers and raw material procurement
- Financial Services to detect fraud and money laundry
- Energy, Oil, and Mining to reduce operational costs and smoothen their operations
- Supply chain to find potential distributions and how to mitigate them or find cheaper prices

Despite its benefits, entity resolution poses challenges, especially with large datasets and diverse data sources
lacking unique identifiers. The limitations of rule-based matching, including completeness, complexity, maintenance,
scale, precision, and recall. Additionally, it addresses challenges related to variant data stores and schema variations
in data sources.

### Measuring Developer Productivity

This was a great article by Gergely Orosz and Abi Noda and the summary I understood is to work backward and use metrics
to improve what is currently degrading rather than finding what to measure. Because you improve what you measure and it
can be abused by bad actors.

So instead of measuring number of PRs, you might actually measure team satisfaction and burnouts which might be the
cause for lower PRs in a team. The idea is to find a metric and then direct it to a root cause that needs to be solved
and improved.

The article also show how developer productivity is measured across various tech companies and introduces a framework to
measure it which are called DORA & SPACE:

- **DORA**: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate and Time to Restore Service
- **SPACE**: Satisfaction and wellbeing, Performance, Activity, Communication and collaboration and Efficiency and flow.

And in general, try to find what makes your developers slower and improve it rather than trying to measure developers
themselves as if they are a cost-center rather than a value generator.

### Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)

The Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol is an open, standardized protocol designed to automate
the process of deploying and renewing digital certificates, primarily for securing communications over the internet
using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

The process for issuing and renewing certificates is complex and error-prone, involving obtaining and managing digital
certificates by interacting with a certificate authority (CA) and a web server or application. ACME automates these
interactions, ensuring that certificates are regularly renewed without manual intervention.

The ACME protocol involves two main actors: an ACME client (usually running on a web server or application) and an ACME
server (operated by a CA, like Let's Encrypt). The client communicates with the server to request, renew, or revoke
certificates.

Certificate Request Process:

- Account Creation: The client first creates an account with the ACME server, which involves generating a key pair and
  sending the public key to the server. This account is used for authenticating all future interactions.
- Domain Validation: To prove control over a domain, the client chooses one of several validation methods and the ACME
  server issues a challenge, and the client must respond correctly, proving it controls the domain.
- Certificate Issuance: Once domain control is verified, the client submits a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the
  ACME server. The CA then signs and issues the certificate and sends it back to the client.
- Certificate Renewal: ACME automates certificate renewal by periodically repeating the validation and issuance steps
  before the certificate expires.
- Certificate Revocation: The protocol also supports certificate revocation if a key is compromised or the domain is no
  longer under the client’s control.

There are other protocols similar to ACME that are used to manage X.509 certificates such as :

- Certificate Management Protocol (CMP)
- Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)
- Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)

### What is CORS?

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, a mechanism that allows web servers to specify which origins are allowed
to access the resources on the server. It is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent unauthorized
access to resources on a different domain. It's a client side (Browser in our case) security feature.

When a web application makes a request to a server on a different domain, the browser enforces the Same-Origin Policy,
which restricts the request based on the origin of the request. If the request is from a different origin, the browser
blocks the request to prevent Cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).

We can divide the history of servers handling requests into two eras:

- Pre-CORS: Where there was no idea about CORS and each server will take to itself. So we weren't aware about cross
  domain requests
- Post-CORS: This is when APIs came in and it's the norm for websites to call each others to changes to resources

`GET` requests are usually safe but the problem arises when we have `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` requests which can change
resources.

Imagine this scenario:

- User is logged into bank.com website
- He visits evil.com website
- evil.com sends a POST request to bank.com to transfer money to another account
- The browser will send the cookies of bank.com to the server

This is where CORS comes in. It's a way to tell the browser that it's safe to allow evil.com to send a POST request to
bank.com using the cookies of bank.com.

So instead of just sending the request immediately, the browser will send a preflight request `OPTION` to the server to
ask if it's safe to send the request. The server will respond with the allowed methods and headers and then the browser
will send the actual request and in this case it can block it if bank.com allow CORS, but it was implemented correctly
to only accept requests from bank.com using the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

Of course, if the bank.com is old before Pre-CORS era, it won't respond to the preflight request and the browser will
block the request and protect the user.

### Moving to Linux away from Windows

Because of the potential of AI and the greed of Big Tech companies, they now would like to harvest our data free of
charge in order to build their AI models to increase their profits over our privacy. That's why there is a rising
concern among the tech community to move to Linux and away from Windows.

Check out this video on the backstory and get ready for the future move to Linux:

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3T63v_qaWs)

### PeerTube

With the increasing censorship of Big Tech companies, there is a growing movement to decentralize the internet and move
away from centralized platforms and use federated platforms. They are mostly under the name of "De-google the internet"
or "Fediverse".

YouTube is one of those major platforms and it has a replacement called PeerTube developed by the French non-profit
organization Framasoft. It's a decentralized video hosting platform that uses peer-to-peer technology to distribute the
bandwidth and contains most of the functionalities of YouTube like commenting, liking, subscribing, live video, ...etc.

You can also follow content creators from other Federated PeerTubes and see their content on your own PeerTube instance.

### Kubernetes Ingress

Kubernetes Clusters have multiple Nodes and each node has a certain IP address. It will be hard to remember each IP
address to access Pods/Services on these Nodes. That's where Ingress comes in. It acts like a reverse proxy to route
traffic to the correct Pod/Service in the Kubernetes Cluster.

An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that consists of two parts:

- Ingress Resource: It defines the rules for routing traffic to the correct Service.
- Ingress Controller: It is a Pod that runs an Ingress Controller like Nginx, Traefik, etc.

One of the most famous Ingress Controllers is Nginx Ingress Controller.

up:

### HTTPS, SSL and TLS: What is the difference?

HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It's the secure version of HTTP and is used to transmit encrypted
data between a client (ex: Browser) and a server.

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and is a protocol that secures the data transmission between a client and a server.
Then, TLS came in which is a successor of SSL and stands for Transport Layer Security. TLS 1.2 is the most used version
and TLS 1.3 is the newest version.

We will talk about TLS 1.2. It's uses both asymmetric and symmetric encryption:

- Asymmetric encryption is used to exchange the symmetric key
- Symmetric encryption is used to encrypt the data and act as a session key

Steps:

1. TCP handshake is initiated between the client and the server
2. The client sends a `ClientHello` message to the server with the highest TLS version it supports and ciphers suites.

- A cipher suite is a set of algorithms that help secure the connection and consists of:
  - Key Exchange Algorithm: Used to exchange the symmetric key
  - Bulk Authentication Algorithm: Used to encrypt the data
  - Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithm: Used to verify the integrity of the data

3. The server responds with a `ServerHello` message with the chosen cipher, TLS, a random number and the server
   certificate
4. The client verifies the server certificate with a Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt
5. The client then needs to generate a session key to encrypt the data. It can be done using:

- Using RSA Key Exchange: Client generates a random session key called `PreMasterSecret` and encrypts it with the
  server's public key and sends it to the server which decrypts it with its private key and then uses it as a session
  key for encrypting further messages.
- Using Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to generate the session key which has the advantage of "Forward Secrecy"
  which means that even if the private key of the server is compromised, the previous messages are still secure.

6. The client and the server can now communicate with the symmetric Session key.

Symmetric encryption is faster than asymmetric encryption and that's why we use it for the data transmission.

From what I found, embed is older than object. object doesn’t have full support of IE as it wasn’t correctly
implemented. Back in the days, they were mostly used to run Flash scripts in the browser. Nowadays, you might need them
to render a pdf into the browser.

Main difference is that object give more options and it offers to show a fallback content in case of failure. So, if you
would like to get all the extra features of object while still supporting IE (for some reason), then you can include
embed inside the object tag.

Example:

```html
<object data="your-document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="600" height="400">
  <!-- Fallback content for browsers that don't support inline PDF rendering -->
  <embed src="your-document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="600" height="400" />
  It appears your browser does not support inline PDF rendering. You can
  <a href="your-document.pdf" download>download the PDF</a> instead.
</object>
```

### Sandboxing apps in macOS

Sandboxing is a technique used to isolate applications from the rest of the system, limiting their access to resources
and data. This helps to prevent malicious applications from causing harm to the system or user data.

MacOS provides a feature called `sandbox-exec` that allows applications to run in a restricted environment. There isn't
much information about it and you will have to use some trial and error to get it working.

You will need to create a profile file that defines the permissions for the application. Here is an example of a
profile:

```
(version 1)
;; Disallow everything by default
(deny default)

;;
;; This system profile grants access to a number of things, such as:
;;
;;  - locale info
;;  - system libraries (/System/Library, /usr/lib, etc)
;;  - access to to basic tools (/etc, /dev/urandom, etc)
;;  - Apple services (com.apple.system, com.apple.dyld, etc)
;;
;; and more, see bsd.sb and system.sb in the corresponding directory.
;;
(import "/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/bsd.sb")
```

and then run the application using the `sandbox-exec` command.

```shell
sandbox-exec -f profile.sb /path/to/application
```

It's also useful if your application is going to run another application that you don't trust. You can sandbox the child
application to prevent it from causing harm to the system.

# Running Unsigned Apps on macOS

Seems like as the worlds is getting into a manufactured recession, the tech companies are trying to cut costs and
squeeze as much profit as they can. The recent of these approaches is by big tech companies to make developers sign
their software. Essentially rendering your expensive $4,000 laptop into a brick.

Since macOS 15.1, Apple now forces apps to be signed to run on the system. It used to be possible to open unsigned apps
by right-click and select "Open" but now it doesn't work anymore.

There are still few ways to run unsigned apps on macOS:

1. Remove the quarantine attribute from the app

```
xattr -cr /Applications/AppName.app
```

1. You can self-sign your app

```
codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/AppName.app
```

1. Also, macOS has a feature called Gatekeeper that prevents unsigned applications from running on the system. This is a
   security feature that helps to protect the system from malicious applications. You can disable it by running the
   following command:

```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

### Some ideas

Operating systems has list of standards to allow programs access to certain tools. Some of these standards are:

- POSIX: Portable Operating System Interface. Used by Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
- WinAPI: Windows Application Programming Interface. Used by Windows operating systems.

Cgywin can help with translating POSIX to WinAPI.

# Boot and System Initialization

When we power on our computer, there are many components that take part to bring our computer to life. Some of them are:

- [TPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module): Trusted Platform Module. It is a hardware component that
  stores cryptographic keys and other sensitive data. It can also be used to verify that the boot process starts with a
  trusted combination of hardware and software.
- [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS): Basic Input/Output System. It is a firmware that initializes the hardware
  and loads the operating system.
- [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI): Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It is a modern replacement for BIOS
  that provides a more flexible and extensible interface for booting the operating system. There is also open-source
  implementation of UEFI called [TianoCore](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2)
- [Bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_loader): It is a program that loads the operating system into memory
  and starts it. There are many bootloaders like GRUB, LILO, SYSLINUX, etc.
- [Boot manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_manager): It is a program that allows the user to select which
  operating system to boot. It is usually part of the bootloader. Example: GRUB2, rEFInd, etc.
- [Disk partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning): It is the process of dividing a disk into
  multiple logical sections. Each section can be used to store a different operating system or data. There are many
  partitioning schemes like MBR, GPT, etc. Information about different partitions is stored in the partition table and
  it can be edited with some software like GParted.
  - [MBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record): Master Boot Record. It is an old partitioning scheme that
    supports up to 4 primary partitions or 3 primary partitions and 1 extendable partition and a maximum disk size of
    2TB.
  - [GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table): GUID Partition Table. It is a modern partitioning scheme
    that supports up to 128 partitions and a maximum disk size of 9.4ZB (Zettabytes). It is used by UEFI systems.
  - [Partition table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_table): It is a data structure that stores information
    about the partitions on a disk. It is used by the bootloader to load the operating system. Some important partitions
    are:
    - [EFI System Partition (ESP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition): It is a partition that contains
      the bootloader and other files needed to boot the operating system. It is used by UEFI systems.
    - [BIOS Boot Partition (BBP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_boot_partition): It is a partition that contains
      the bootloader and other files needed to boot the operating system. It is used by BIOS systems.
    - System partition: It's the one used to boot the operating system. It contains the kernel and other files needed to
      boot the operating system. It could be the `/root` partition in Linux or the `C:` drive in Windows.

# Network Time Protocol

NTP is a protocol used to sync clocks among devices over the network. It uses UDP with port 123. Each device is
connected to another devices with higher time precision and they are called "Stratum" and can be summed as:

- Stratum 0: These are atomic clocks
- Stratum 1: Devices connected to Stratum 0 and act as the primary servers
- Stratum 2+: Receive time from higher stratum and serve it to lower ones.

This is how it works:

- A packer is sent from the client with the time send
- Server record time received and sends back also the time it send the response
- Client also records time receives and uses these 4 times to calculate the offset

Examples of software implementation is [`chronyd`](https://chrony-project.org/).

# WebDav

It's an HTTP-based protocol used to collaboratively manage files on a remote server. You can think of it as similar to
FTP but also with other collaborative features like namespaces, authors and locking. It's defined in
[RFC 4918](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4918).

It has some HTTP methods like: `COPY`, `LOCK`, `MKCOL`, `MOVE` and `PROPPATCH`.

There are some important extensions as well for it like:

- ([RFC 6578](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6578)) WebDAV Sync: for syncing
- ([RFC 4791](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4791)) CalDAV: for calendar management and support the iCalender
  `.ics` format. Methods like `MKCALENDAR` are used to create calendar.
- ([RFC 6352](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6352)) CardDav: for contacts management. Methods like `REPORT` to
  query contacts. It supports vCard `.vcf` properties.
- ([RFC 3253](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3253)) DeltaV: add version control.
- ([RFC 3648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3648)) Ordered Collections: Allow manual ordering of files and
  folders.
- ([RFC 4331](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4331)) Quota Support: managing storage limits
- ([RFC 3744](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3744)) Principal Management: manages access control

Many cloud storage providers still uses WebDav like: NextCloud, iCloud and OneDrive. Thunderbird still uses CalDav for
calendar management.

# Bloom Filter

It's a probabilistic data structure which just says in an item "probably exists" or "definitely doesn't exist". It has
only two operations which are set and get. You can't remove as it will require creating a new space from scratch. The
easiest implementation is having a large array of bits and a hashing function and whenever we add an item we hash it and
set the bits in the hash function. When we need to check if the item exists, we hash it and check if the bits are set in
the array.

This is useful when we want to save on expensive operations like accessing databases or reading from disk.

There are other variations of bloom filters:

- Counting Bloom Filter: Adds counters for each bit to support deletions.
- Scalable Bloom Filter: Grows dynamically to maintain target false positive rate.
- Compressed Bloom Filter: Reduces space via compression, trading off accuracy.
- Partitioned Bloom Filter: Splits bit array by hash functions for better cache performance.
- Cuckoo Filter: Supports deletions and approximate set membership using cuckoo hashing.
- Spectral Bloom Filter: Tracks element frequency using counter arrays.

The most important parameter we need to create a bloom filter is to know its size and there is an equation that can
drive this from the false positive error rate and number of elements expected.

# Unicode

Encoding is the process of assigning numbers to characters which helps in the electronic storage and transmission of
data using computers. The first and most famous one was ASCII but it was limited to 8-bit characters. Now, the most
widely used one is Unicode which represents characters using 1-4 bytes.

The process of transforming from Unicode to binary data is done with UTF "Unicode Transformation Format". The most
popular and widely used one is UTF-8 and it's backward compatible with ASCII. There is also UTF-16 and UTF-32. UTF-8 can
represent up to a theoretical limit of 1,112,064 unicode points and it's the mostly adopted.

Each unicode has a template or a transformation process. For UTF-8 it can represent unicode with 1-4 bytes depending on
the size of the unicode code. The code then is transformed into binary and put into a template. This is as follows

- `U+0000` to `U+007F` -> `0xxxxxxx`
- `U+0000` to `U+007F` -> `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx`
- `U+0800` to `U+FFFF` -> `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
- `U+10000` to `U+10FFFF` -> `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`

# NAT Slipstreaming

NAT Slipstreaming is a security technique (or exploit) that allows an attacker to bypass a victim's NAT (Network Address
Translation) or firewall protections, enabling unauthorized access to internal network services by tricking the victim’s
browser into initiating connections.

Here how it works:

- Victim Visits a Malicious Website: The user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted page.
- Browser Sends Packets Automatically: The page uses JavaScript or other browser features to make the browser send
  specially crafted network packets (like HTTP or SIP requests) to the attacker. This can happen with WebRTC or VoIP for
  example.
- NAT/Firewall Opens Ports: The attack leverages how some NAT devices handle certain protocols (e.g. SIP, FTP) by
  dynamically opening ports when they see certain types of outbound traffic.
- Attacker Gains Access: The attacker uses the opened port to send traffic directly to the victim's machine on the
  internal network, bypassing firewall protections.

Defense against it include using updated browsers and disabling ALG functions on routers.
